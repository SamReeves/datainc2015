#### Dear folks at The Data Incubator:


#### This challenge process was a blast, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it!

***

##### Here you will find some scripts that I used to solve the first set of challenge questions.  **I recommend viewing them in an IPython Notebook** (file.ipynb) or if you like, you can simply view the code and execute in IPython.

##### In order to solve for the random walk questions, I imagined what I knew about other random walk scenarios.  I recalled a [story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_carlo_simulation#History) from the scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and decided a Monte Carlo simulation was a fun idea.


1. createTheData.ipynb

... This script generates a JSON files which contain the random walks.  I found that random.randint() was significantly less random than random.choice('True','False').

2. siftAndPlot.ipynb

... I wrote this code to assess my 'random' data and to make sure it simulated what I wanted it to simulate.

3. calculations.ipynb

... This IPython Notebook contains the expressions that I used to find my actual responses.

NOTE: I had so much fun making sandcastles with the data, that I generated more sets than necessary.  Instead of making separate sets for each trial size, one large dataset could be referenced for all the questions.........
